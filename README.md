# TestingProject
Just testing GitHub after removing Archipelago
I removed Archipelago because it was written in VB.NET and evidently nobody seems to want that!
So....I am in the process of converting to C# (away from GitHub). Maybe then it will find more interested audience.
Whenever I feel the project is worthy of publishing here, I will upload
The project can serve as a fairly complete teaching platform for those interested in learning OpenGL (through OpenTK)
Thanks to the good folks that have kept OpenTK alive
